# Two-Player-Chess
Two player offline chess in html, css and javascript. 

This was made as a group project for a web development class.  I was responsible for writing the game logic which makes up over 800 lines of code.

# Chess Refactoring Assignment
After grabbing this game off a public GitHub, I decided to use this project for my class assignment. In which, I will refactor the code to use
better coding principles, touch up a few features, and add a new game mode: "Chess960". -Bob C.
